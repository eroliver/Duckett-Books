    <h1>Images Tables and Forms</h1>
    <p>This page will show you some examples of images, tables and forms in the most basic way, with plain HTML.</p>
    </br>
    <p>I want to demonstrate the impact and progressiion of CSS on the next two pages, so this page, like the last will not be the most eye catching.</p>
    <h3>For Example</h3>
    <img src="images/graphics/html_book_picture.jpg" alt="Picture of Jon Duckett's Web Design Books" title="Photo by Greg Rakozy on Unsplash" height = 200 width = 200 >
    <br>This is a photo using only HTML and I'm sure you don't often see images online like this anymore. Notably, this picture has a fixed size of 200 pixels by 200 pixels, and may seem large on your phone, but small on your computer.</br>
    You probably never encounter images like this anymore because most people browse online on their phones and even between phones there is quite a range of sizes. It would be much less user friendly if you always had to deal with images</br>
    of varying sizes. We will revisit this later when we use CSS to shape images dynamically based on our display size.</p>

    <h3>HTML Tables</h3>
    <p>Tables are another html toolin the HTML toolkit that you have likely never seen without extensive styling.</p>
    <p>It is good practice to only use tables as tables, but some people use tables in creative ways. Even some web layouts
        have been created using the table tags: tr and td, but this is not advisable.

       <h1>Simple Web Title(using h1 attribute)</h1>
       <p>This website is to showcase all of the web development skills you will learn in Jon Duckett's book <i>HTML&CSS.</i>
        /n Often times, I struggle to find project that I want to work on because they have no meaning. Tutorials say make a calculator, a clock, a Facebook clone, but why? with these projects I wind up completely unmotivated and absolutely create the easiest most basic version of the project just to have it done and then I don't even want to save it because what's the point? So I have decided to create two web pages that just show basic web development fundamentals as they are learned from Jon Duckett's books because I enjoyed these books and I think they're a great resource for people who want to learn about web development. I will try to use every tool in the book and often point out when certain attributes or techniques are being used.</p>
       <p>This page shows the basics of HTML structure, lists, links, and images as Jon Duckett explains in his book <i>HTML&CSS</i>.</p>
       <h2>Sub-headings are used as section titles</h2>
       <p>Throughout the web page, and eventually the web site, I will use more advanced techniques to show the <b>progression</b> a new web developer will expeience.</p>
       <hr />
       <p>Many of these things will be used without much of a reason other than to make sure that they are included such as a line break here<br />
       and the use of a subcript<sub>here</sub> and a superscript<sup>here</sup>. For times sake, I will stop formatting text since this will be covered in CSS sections.</p>
       <h2>Don't use p tags for everything.</h2>
       <p>Even though CSS will be used for formatting, it is still important to markup your web page.</p>
       <h3>HTML lists</h3>
       <dl>
           <dt>definition lists(dl)</dt>
           <dd>These lists are used for terms and their meanings, like you would see in a dictionary and how I am listing each type of list here.</dd>
           <dt>Ordered Lists</dt>
           <dd>These are lists ordered by number or some other parameter. <br />
            <ol>
                <li>Make a list.</li>
                <li></li>
            </ol>
        </dd>
        
       </dl>
</body>

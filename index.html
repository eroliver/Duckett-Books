       <h1>Simple Web Title(using h1 attribute)</h1>
       <p>This website is to showcase all of the web development skills you will learn in Jon Duckett's book <i>HTML&CSS.</i>
        /n Often times, I struggle to find project that I want to work on because they have no meaning. Tutorials say make a calculator, a clock, a Facebook clone, but why? with these projects I wind up completely unmotivated and absolutely create the easiest most basic version of the project just to have it done and then I don't even want to save it because what's the point? So I have decided to create two web pages that just show basic web development fundamentals as they are learned from Jon Duckett's books because I enjoyed these books and I think they're a great resource for people who want to learn about web development. I will try to use every tool in the book and often point out when certain attributes or techniques are being used.</p>
       <p>This page shows the basics of HTML structure, lists, links, and images as Jon Duckett explains in his book <i>HTML&CSS</i>.</p>
